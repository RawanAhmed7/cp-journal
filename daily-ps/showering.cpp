As a computer science student, Alex faces a hard challenge â€” showering. He tries to shower daily, but despite his best efforts there are always challenges. He takes s
 minutes to shower and a day only has m
 minutes!

He already has n
 tasks planned for the day. Task i
 is represented as an interval (li
, ri)
, which means that Alex is busy and can not take a shower in that time interval (at any point in time strictly between li
 and ri
). No two tasks overlap.

Given all n
 time intervals, will Alex be able to shower that day? In other words, will Alex have a free time interval of length at least s
?
